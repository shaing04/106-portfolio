                <li>Develped a ML program using a FFNN with an implicit model and deep learning in Python to detech earthquake waves using PyTorch and Seisbench with cross-entropy loss to improve real time seismic monitoring</li>
                <li>Generated seismic wave and model loss graphs from raw data into actionable insights by performing statistical & qualititative analyses to aggregate size, strength, and location of earthquakes and communicate model accuracies</li>
                <li>Automate seismic wave detection by applying a state-driven implicit deep learning model with SAFE feature eliminiation to enhance model efficiency without expensive training</li>

            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a research framework to explore the relationship between UCSD students' academic workload and their music preferences, utilitizing Spotify API's 'Top Tracks This Month' and emotional tone metrics (valence) with student stress surveys to quantify music preference and valence shifts during exam season</li>
                <li>Identiied and addressed potential ethical concerns and biases, proposing participant pseudonymization, survey randomization, and demographic stratification to ensure representative sampling, data transparency, and the ethical use of personal data while considering confounding factors such as sleep and genre preferences</li>
                <li>Structured a data analysis pipeline to investigate stress-music correlations, outlining steps for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Pearson's R correlation testing, and dynamic visualization with Seaborn/Matplotlib to examine student valence trends across academic cycles</li>

            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducted EDA and data visualization using Python Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to identify correlations between work mode (remote, hybrid, and in-person) and job satisfaction, factoring in the effect age, salary level, and educational level had on job satisfaction</li>
                <li>Performed ANOVA analyses identifying key satisfaction drivers: 18-24-year-olds were 10.1% less satisfied in- office than hybrid, while Master's holders reported 5.4% higher in-person satisfaction than Bachelor's, with education showing no significant hybrid/remote effects</li>
                <li>Utlized OLS regression analysis (n=16,062), which revealed salary had minimal practical impact on job satisfaction despite statistical signifigance explaining only 0.6% of variance suggesting a $50,000 salary increase would predict just 0.14-point higher satisfaction on a 10-point scale</li>
