    <h1>Susana</h1>
    <p>I'm passionate about taking data and turning it into meaningful insights. I have interests in 
        researching education, health, and social issues to make a positive impact in our communities.
        Outside of academics, I hope to pursue a career in Business Intelligence to help drive 
        informed decision-making and growth. 

        This is currently a work in progress, so please check back soon for updates!
