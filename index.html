    <h1 class = "page-titles">Hi, I'm Susana!</h1>
    <p>I'm passionate about taking data and turning it into meaningful insights. I have interests in 
        researching education, health, and social issues to make a positive impact in our communities.
        Outside of academics, I hope to pursue a career in Business Intelligence to help drive 
        informed decision-making and growth.
